\title{repurrrsive: Examples of Recursive Lists and Nested or Split Data Frames}
\description{
Recursive lists in the form of R objects, 'JSON', and 'XML', for use in
    teaching and examples. Examples include color palettes, Game of Thrones
    characters, 'GitHub' users and repositories, and entities from the Star Wars
    universe. Data from the 'gapminder' package is also included, as a simple data
    frame and in nested and split forms.
