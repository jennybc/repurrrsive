\description{
This tibble contains the results of geocoding five cities
("Houston", "Washington", "New York", "Chicago", "Arlington") using
the Google Maps API on 2022-06-08. Two cities, Washington and Arlington,
were deliberately picked for their ambiguity: Washington could refer
to the city or the state, and Arlington could mean the one in Virginia or
the one in Texas.
