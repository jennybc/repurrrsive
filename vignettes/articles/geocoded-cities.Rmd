title: "Geocoded cities"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

```{r setup}

```

The `gmaps_cities` data frame contains the results of geocoding five cities
("Houston", "Washington", "New York", "Chicago", "Arlington") using
the Google Maps API on 2022-06-08.
The geocoding data appears in the `json` list-column.

```{r}
gmaps_cities
```

Two cities, Washington and Arlington, were deliberately picked for their ambiguity: Washington could refer to the city or the state, and Arlington could mean the one in Virginia or
the one in Texas.
This dataset is useful for exploring the [rectangling capabilities](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html) of the tidyr package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

gmaps_cities %>% 
  hoist(json, "results") %>% 
  select(-json) %>% 
  unnest_longer(results) %>% 
  hoist(results, "formatted_address")
```
