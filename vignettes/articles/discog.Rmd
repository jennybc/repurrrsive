```{r setup}

```

`discog` holds a list of 155 items, representing a music collection stored in the Discogs database and retrieved via their API.
It's useful for demonstrating capabilities of purrr and tidyr.

```{r}
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```

Here we get just the album names:

```{r}
discog %>% 
  map_chr(c("basic_information", "title")) %>% 
  head()
```

Put the `discog` list into a list-column and use `tidyr::hoist()` to dig some info out of it.

```{r}
tibble(disc = discog) %>% 
  hoist(disc, info = "basic_information") %>% 
  hoist(info,
       title = "title",
       year = "year",
       label = list("labels", 1, "name"),
       artist = list("artists", 1, "name")
  ) %>% 
  select(-disc, -info)
```
